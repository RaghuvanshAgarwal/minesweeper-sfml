# Minesweeper
This is a recreation of the classic **Minesweeper** game, made in SFML library and c++ language as part of Array module in Outscal's AAA Game Programmer Path, by the end of the module I was able to learn/implement the following things
* 2D Array Operations
* Flood Fill Algorithm
* Proper OOPs concepts
* Basic Scene System
* Connect different game systems with one another.
## Controls
* Left Mouse Button -> Open the cell
* Right Mouse Button -> Toggle Flag
